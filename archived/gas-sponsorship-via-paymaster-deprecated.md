# Gas Sponsorship via Paymaster (deprecated)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since upgrading from the Smart Wallet (based on contracts) to the [Capminal Wallet](../capminal/product-features/capminal-wallet.md) (a server-based wallet), we no longer support Paymaster. This change is intended to support future multichain capabilities.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Swap, deploy, transfer tokens on **Capminal** with **gas-free**
