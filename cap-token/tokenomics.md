# Tokenomics

## CAP Token

Token Name: **Capminal**

Token Symbol: **CAP**

Max Supply: **1,000,000,000 CAP**

## Tokenomics

We focus on the long-term vision for our CAP token, with these key highlights:

* At TGE, only Public Sale participants will receive tokens
* The first unlock occurring one month after TGE (VIRTUALS yappers and stakers, KOL & Media channels)
* Early backers will receive their allocation after two months, subject to a vesting schedule.
* The Team and DAO Treasury allocations will be distributed after three months and six months, also with vesting.

3% supply is for [CAP Points](../capminal/product-features/cap-xp.md) program. Don't miss out.

* Monthly buyback and burn of CAP using trading fees and Clanker UI fees.
* Main payment token within the Capminal ecosystem:
