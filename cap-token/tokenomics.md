## Tokenomics

We focus on the long-term vision for our CAP token, with these key highlights:

* At TGE, only Public Sale participants will receive tokens
* The first unlock occurring one month after TGE.
* Early backers will receive their allocation after two months, subject to a vesting schedule.
* The Team and DAO Treasury allocations will be distributed after three months and six months, also with vesting.

## Use cases

When designing the use cases for Capminal (CAP), our focus is on increasing scarcity and reducing the supply of CAP over time. Here are the key use cases:

* CAP will serve as the main payment token within the Capminal ecosystem.
* Use CAP for VIP subscriptions to enjoy reduced trading fees and access to priority features.
* CAP will be used for future service payments (details to be announced).
* Hold CAP to receive airdrops from partner projects.
* CAP will be fully supported by DackieSwap Yield Farming.
* Monthly buyback and burn of CAP using trading fees and Clanker UI fees.
* Use CAP for governance.
