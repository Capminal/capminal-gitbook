## Swap

Swap XP is the XP you earn by swapping on Capminal. The rules is as follows:

* 1 USD = 1 Swap XP.
* ETH/WETH is NOT calculated in Swap XP.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you swap **CAP** token, you will receive **35%** more Swap XP compared to swapping other tokens. For example: swap $100 CAP token = 135 Swap XP
{% endhint %}

## CAP Staking

{% hint style="info" %}
Please refer [CAP Staking](cap-xp.md#cap-staking) feature to learn how to stake CAP on Capminal, what is 'Shares'
{% endhint %}

After you stake CAP, your Staking XP will automatically increase every day according to the following formula.

* Daily Staking XP = Shares / 2000 (adjustment factor)

{% hint style="info" %}
Example:

* You stake 100,000 CAP in 1 week → your share is 100,000

→ Your daily Staking XP is 100,000 / 2000 = **50 XP / day**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Adjustment factor will be adjust in the future to match with CAP USD price
{% endhint %}

## Total CAP XP

{% hint style="info" %}
**CAP** XP will be used for **CAP** **airdrop** ( refer [Tokenomics](../../cap-token/tokenomics.md) ) **→  it's already DONE**
{% endhint %}

CAP XP are calculated as follows:

* CAP XP = ( Swap XP + Staking XP ) \* ( 1 + Boost)

{% hint style="info" %}
Example:

* Your Swap XP = 1000
* Your Staking XP = 1000
* Your Boosted = 20%

→ Your CAP XP = (1000 + 1000) \* 120% = 2400
{% endhint %}

## Referrals and Boost

Referrals represent the number of users you have invited. This number is used to boost your CAP XP. The rules are as follows:

* Each referral has swap volume greater than 10 USD will be 1% boosted percentage.
* There are no limit for the number of referrals you can invite.
* Your CAP XP will be updated back fill if your boosted percentage increase.

{% hint style="info" %}
The maximum boosted percentage is **25%** except how many referrals you have.
{% endhint %}
