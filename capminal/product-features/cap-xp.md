# CAP XP

## What is CAP XP

CAP XP tracks users' Swap Volume, CAP Staking, Referrals, and Boosts on Capminal. Every month, we use protocol fees to buy back CAP and reward top users on the CAP XP leaderboard.

#### Monthly Capminal Protocol Fee Distribution Rate:

<table><thead><tr><th width="575.41015625">#</th><th>Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Team</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>Buy Back CAP &#x26; Distribute to CAP XP Leaderboard</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>Buy Back CAP &#x26; Burn</td><td>30%</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Example:

If Capminal Protocol fee is $5,000 this month

→ CAP XP rewards = 30% \* $5,000 = **$1,500** / this month
{% endhint %}

The rules to earn CAP XP are simple and easy to understand, just based on referrals and volume.

## Swap XP

Swap XP is the XP you earn by swapping on Capminal. The rules is as follows:

* 1 USD = 1 Swap XP.
* ETH/WETH is NOT calculated in Swap XP.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you swap **CAP** token, you will receive **35%** more Swap XP compared to swapping other tokens. For example: swap $100 CAP token = 135 Swap XP
{% endhint %}

## CAP Staking XP

{% hint style="info" %}
Please refer [CAP Staking](cap-staking.md) feature to learn how to stake CAP on Capminal, understand Multiplier and Shares
{% endhint %}

After you stake CAP, your Staking XP will automatically increase every day according to the following formula.

* Daily Staking XP = Shares / 2000 (adjustment factor)

{% hint style="info" %}
Example:

* You stake 100,000 CAP in 1 week → your share is 100,000

→ Your daily Staking XP is 100,000 / 2000 = **50 XP / day**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The adjustment factor may be revised monthly in the future based on the weighting between trading volume and staking.
{% endhint %}

## Total CAP XP

CAP XP are calculated as follows:

* CAP XP = ( Swap XP + Staking XP ) \* ( 1 + Boost)

{% hint style="info" %}
Example:

* Your Swap XP = 1000
* Your Staking XP = 1000
* Your Boosted = 20%

→ Your CAP XP = (1000 + 1000) \* 120% = 2400
{% endhint %}

## Referrals and Boost

Referrals represent the number of users you have invited. This number is used to boost your CAP XP. The rules are as follows:

* Each referral has swap volume greater than 10 USD will be 1% boosted percentage.
* There are no limit for the number of referrals you can invite.
* Your CAP XP will be updated back fill if your boosted percentage increase.

{% hint style="info" %}
The maximum boosted percentage is **25%** except how many referrals you have.
