{% endhint %}

## Trading by typing

In Capminal, you just need to command to execute a swap transaction in seconds. There are some example commands that your can refer:

* `Swap 0.1 ETH to DACKIE`
* `Buy 1000$ of DACKIE by ETH`
* `Sell a half of DACKIE for USDC`
* `Swap all USDC to DACKIE`&#x20;

## Trading on social platform (X, Farcaster)

We also support user tag [@captain\_dackie](https://x.com/captain_dackie) on X or Farcaster (coming soon) to command the TRANSFER, SWAP or DEPLOY transaction. But user have to register and deposit fund to Capminal account first to start trading on social post.

## Swap Fee

Capminal charge `0.5%` swap fee for each SWAP transaction based on volume.

We will begin applying swap fee reduction models once the product has passed the alpha stage.
