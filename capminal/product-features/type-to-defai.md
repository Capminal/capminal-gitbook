## Multisend Support

Capminal also supports the multi-send feature via the command below. This is a useful tool for distributing tokens to the community, whether for rewards or airdrops. Some prompt that you can refer:\`

* `Distribute 100$ USDC each person  to @andreapn_ @dackieswap @dackieverse`&#x20;
* `Airdrop 100$ USDC each person  to @andreapn_ @dackieswap @dackieverse`&#x20;
* `Separate 100$ USDC then distribute to @andreapn_ @dackieswap @dackieverse`&#x20;

## Airdrop Feature

**Pre-condition:**\
Ensure that you (the airdrop thread owner) have enough of the airdrop token in your Capminal account balance.

**Your airdrop post should include the following information:**

1. Amount of tokens per recipient (not the total amount)
2. Token symbol and token address
3. Number of participants (can be X premium or not, just add keyword 'premium' 'blue checkmark'...)
4. Instructions for users to comment

**Notes:**

1. Remind your users to register a Capminal account first, as tokens will be sent directly to their Capminal accounts.
2. The airdrop thread becomes active once you receive a “ready” confirmation from Captain.
3. Captain will only respond to users who receive the airdrop. Due to high comment volume, responding first does not guarantee being handled first, please be happy if you don’t get an airdrop.

## Trading on social platform (X, Farcaster)

We also support user tag [@captain\_dackie](https://x.com/captain_dackie) on X or Farcaster (coming soon) to command the TRANSFER, SWAP or DEPLOY transaction. But user have to register and deposit fund to Capminal account first to start trading on social post.

## Swap Fee

Capminal charge `0.5%` swap fee for each SWAP transaction based on volume.

We will begin applying swap fee reduction models once the product has passed the alpha stage.
